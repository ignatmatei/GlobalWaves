## Attempting to create an open-source alternative to Spotify

### Requirements to run project :

* node for frontend

* jdk >= 19.x for backend

#### to run only the frontend go to fe/GlobalWaves and run npm i; npm run dev. I primarily used vue & typescript.

#### For now the backend can only run the tests to check if all the logic of the Player, User and Artist is alright (way harder when it sounds when you realize users can stop the song in the player, make a private playlist which only they can see, load the playlist in a player, shuffle the songs in the player, go to some page etc). More details about the general interaction of the classes there in the designed README for backend. To run the tests simply open the project and compile it and you can see if something goes wrong with any of the tests.
